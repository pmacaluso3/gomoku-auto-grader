PICKUP: POST /test_case_outcomes from gomoku-test-suite; test script needs to POST /authenticate w/ admin creds from .env, then set env vars in each test-suite copy: admin token, backend url, submission id, gradingBatch id
NEXT: download folder of applicant zips; view grading batches (each submission should indicate if it's had any of its TCOs touched by hand); view & edit a single submission's TCOs

user experience questions:
    - when applicant logs in w/ blank password before setup, should service tell them they need to go to setup?
    - what happens if applicant tries to setup a second time? maybe it's ok to let them use this to change their password
