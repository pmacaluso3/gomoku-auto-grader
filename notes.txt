PICKUP: download folder of applicant zips; view grading batches (each submission should indicate if it's had any of its TCOs touched by hand); view & edit a single submission's TCOs
NEXT: run junit tests from command line (current attempt in script is not finding any tests)

user experience questions:
    - when applicant logs in w/ blank password before setup, should service tell them they need to go to setup?
    - what happens if applicant tries to setup a second time? maybe it's ok to let them use this to change their password
